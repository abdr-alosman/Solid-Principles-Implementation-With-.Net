# Solid Principles Implementation With .Net/C#
### 1- What is the Single Responsibility Principle in C#?
The Single Responsibility Principle in C# states that “Each software module or class should have only one reason to  change“. In other words, we can say that each module or class should have only one responsibility to do.

### 2- What is the Open-Closed Principle in C#?
The Open-Closed Principle states that “software entities such as modules, classes, functions, etc. should be open for extension, but closed for modification“.

### 3- What is the Liskov Substitution Principle in C#?
The Liskov Substitution Principle is a Substitutability principle in object-oriented programming Language. This principle states that, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T should be replaced with the objects of type S.

### 4- What is the Interface Segregation Principle in C#? 
The Interface Segregation Principle states that “Clients should not be forced to implement any methods they don’t use. Rather than one fat interface, numerous little interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods with each interface serving one submodule“.

### 5- What is the Dependency Inversion Principle in C#?
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes.
Both should depend upon abstractions. Secondly, abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
